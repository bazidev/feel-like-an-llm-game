## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Phase 1: Tokenization
Break down text into tokens - the building blocks of AI language understanding.

### Phase 2: Embeddings
Map words into mathematical space where similar meanings cluster together.

### Phase 3: Attention
Learn which words in a sentence relate to each other and why it matters.

### Phase 4: Prediction
Understand how AI predicts the next token and the role of temperature.

### Phase 5: Training
Experience the training process with epochs, loss curves, and accuracy metrics.

### Phase 6: Applications
Put it all together with real-world AI tasks like summarization and sentiment analysis.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Learn by Doing**: Interactive gameplay over passive reading
- **Simplified Concepts**: Complex ML ideas made accessible
- **Visual Learning**: Animations and visualizations aid understanding
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each phase builds on previous knowledge
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate responses to user actions

## 🔧 Browser Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- LocalStorage enabled
- Canvas support
- ~50MB free storage for optimal performance

## 📊 Game Stats

- **7 Phases**: Complete journey from data to deployment
- **25+ Interactive Challenges**: Hands-on learning
- **Point System**: Track your learning progress
- **Achievements**: Unlock milestones
- **Hints Available**: Never get stuck

## 🎯 Tips for Success

1. **Read the descriptions**: Each phase explains concepts clearly
2. **Use hints**: No shame in learning!
3. **Experiment**: Try different approaches
4. **Take your time**: Understanding matters more than speed
5. **Have fun**: It's a game, enjoy the journey!

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Sound effects use simple tones (placeholder audio)
